## Rules for play
1. The game Bluff is multiplayer card game in which the objective is to have zero cards remaining.
2. Each round, a player can choose to put down n number of cards or pass. If they choose to put down cards, the player can "bluff" (lie about the cards they put down). Upon hearing this, other players (who have not passed in that round) can choose to either continue the game and move to the next player or call bluff on the player that chose to put something down.  
3. If a player wrongly calls bluff on the current player's turn, then the other player receives all the cards that have been played thus far and must play in future rounds with those.
4. In a round, if someone passes, they can't play or call bluff till that round ends. The exception to this rule is that if everyone has passed except for one person, the players who have passed can call bluff on the remaining player. 
5. Once everyone passes the pile of cards on the table is discarded and the player to pass in the end gets to start the next round with the card of his/her/their choice. 
6. The game continues this way until one player has all the cards from the deck.
